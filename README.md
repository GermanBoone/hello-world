At this point I feel most interested in learning 1 python, 2a Rails, 2b Javascript, 3a Java, and 3b Rust.
Howvever none of this is set in stone, as I am still taking CS50 as an intro to feel out exactly what I like.
Why is Python at the top?  It just looks fun and really usefull for interfaceing with (please excuse the catch-phrase) "internet of things", its alos a language with lots of employment prospects, and being that I'm coming from a sientific background it could be usefull if I ever go back to that world.  

I'm also interested in web and mobel development.  Ergo  Rails, Javascript and Java. Someone once pointed out that almost all mobile devices have browser capabilities, so most mobile apps can just be web-apps and thus accessible to a broader audience.  

Rust?  Well, when it was featured on "programming throwdown" it sounded cool and like it might challenge C in systems programming.  If it continues to grow at the rate it has, it would be nice to get in on the ground floor while the language is still young.
